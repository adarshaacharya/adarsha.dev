Goal of this article is to create a resuable DMS (Document Management System) service using NestJS and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) version3 SDK
that should be able to:
- Store public and private files in single S3 bucket.
- Generate pre-signed URLs for private files.
- Perform CRUD operations on S3 objects using NestJS.

## Introduction

By default every object(file) uploaded in AWS S3 bucket is private. So only the owner of the object can access the object.

There might be case where you want to store both public and private files in single S3 bucket. 
For example, you want to store user's profile picture as private and some static files like images, videos, etc. as public.

There are multiple ways to store the public and private files in AWS S3 bucket.
- Creating separate buckets for public and private files.
- Using different folders for public and private files in single bucket using bucket policies.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/public/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Set the ACL (Access Control List) of the object to `public-read` or `private` while uploading the object.


In this article we will explore the third option, i.e. storing both public and private files setting the ACL to each objects in single S3 bucket and generating pre-signed URLs for private files using NestJS and AWS SDK v3.

- For `public` files, we will set the ACL to `public-read` while uploading the object. And once the server returns the URL of the object, the user can access the object using the URL. There won't be any expiration time for the URL so no need to generate extra URL for public files.


- If you are storing the `private` files in S3 bucket, you can generate a pre-signed URL for the object and provide it to the user. The user can access the object using the pre-signed URL for the limited time. After the expiration time, the URL will no longer be valid.

It might be useful when you want to :
- validate the user before providing access to the object.
- check the user's subscription before providing access to the object.
- provide access to the object with specific access permissions, expiration times, and cryptographic signatures, ensuring that only authorized users can access the content.




## Setup


#### AWS S3 Bucket Configuration

- Create a new S3 bucket in [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)


Initially the creation page will look like this:
<Image
  src={"/_static/blogs/aws-s3-nestjs/initial-bucket-page.png"}
  width={1280}
  height={720}
  alt="website card"
/>


Three things to note while creating the bucket:


- Fillout the bucket name
- change ownership to ACLs enabled 
- uncheck the block all public access.

<Image
  src={"/_static/blogs/aws-s3-nestjs/final-bucket-page.png"}
  width={1280}
  height={720}
  alt="website card"
/>


Now our AWS S3 bucket is ready to store the objects. 

Note down the ***Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region, Bucket Name*** credentials from the AWS console which will be used in the NestJS application to access the S3 bucket.


#### NestJS Application Setup

In your NestJS application, install the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`.

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner uuid
```

```bash
npm install -D @types/multer
```


Also `uuid` package is used to generate the unique key for the object whereas `@types/multer` is used to provide the types for the File object.


Create a new module called `dms` which will be handling the document management system operations.

```bash
 npx nest g module dms
 npx nest g service dms
 npx nest g controller dms
```

Also don't forgot to add the AWS S3 credentials in the `.env` file. 

```bash
S3_ACCESS_KEY= # Access Key ID
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= # Secret Access Key
S3_REGION="ap-south-1"  # Region (this might be different for you)
S3_BUCKET_NAME="s3-bucket-blog-demo" # Bucket Name (this might be different for you)
```


I've breakdonw the implementation into multiple steps, at the end of the article you can find the complete implementation of the DMS service.

### Initialize the S3 client

At first we need to initialize the S3 client with the AWS credentials. 

`dms/dms.service.ts`

```typescript
import { Injectable, InternalServerErrorException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';
import {
  S3Client,
  PutObjectCommand,
  DeleteObjectCommand,
  GetObjectCommand,
} from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

@Injectable()
export class DmsService {
  private client: S3Client;
  private bucketName = this.configService.get('S3_BUCKET_NAME');

  constructor(
    private readonly configService: ConfigService,
  ) {
    const s3_region = this.configService.get('S3_REGION');

    if (!s3_region) {
      throw new Error('S3_REGION not found in environment variables');
    }

    this.client = new S3Client({
      region: s3_region,
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: this.configService.get('S3_ACCESS_KEY'),
        secretAccessKey: this.configService.get('S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
      },
      forcePathStyle: true,
    });

  }
}

```

In the above code, we have initialized the S3 client with the AWS credentials and region. The same client instance will be used throughout the 
application to perform the S3 operations.


### Upload the object to S3 bucket


To upload the object to S3 bucket, we need to use the `PutObjectCommand` command from the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` package and create another method `uploadSingleFile` in the same `DmsService` class.

```ts
import { PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';


// methods inside DmsService class
  async uploadSingleFile({
    file,
    isPublic = true,
  }: {
    file: Express.Multer.File;
    isPublic: boolean;
  }) {
    try {
      const key = `${uuidv4()}`;
      const command = new PutObjectCommand({
        Bucket: this.bucketName,
        Key: key,
        Body: file.buffer,
        ContentType: file.mimetype,
        ACL: isPublic ? 'public-read' : 'private',

        Metadata: {
          originalName: file.originalname,
        },
      });

      const uploadResult = await this.client.send(command);

  
      return {
        url: isPublic
          ? (await this.getFileUrl(key)).url
          : (await this.getPresignedSignedUrl(key)).url,
        key,
        isPublic,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new InternalServerErrorException(error);
    }
  }

  async getFileUrl(key: string) {
    return { url: `https://${this.bucketName}.s3.amazonaws.com/${key}` };
  }


 async getPresignedSignedUrl(key: string) {
    try {
      const command = new GetObjectCommand({
        Bucket: this.bucketName,
        Key: key,
      });

      const url = await getSignedUrl(this.client, command, {
        expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours
      });

      return { url };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new InternalServerErrorException(error);
    }
  }

// ...other code

```

In the above code, we have created a new method `uploadSingleFile` which takes the `file` and `isPublic` flag as input.

The `PutObjectCommand` command is used to upload the object to the S3 bucket taking the different inputs like `Bucket`, `Key`, `Body`, `ContentType`, `ACL`, `Metadata`.
The Key is generated using the `uuidv4` method which will be unique for each object, so that we can use it to access the object later.


- If the file is public, we set the ACL to `public-read` and return the URL of the file using the `getFileUrl` method.

- If the file is private, we set the ACL to `private` and generate the pre-signed URL for the file and return the URL using the `getPresignedSignedUrl` method.


Since the signed URL is valid for the limited time, we have set the expiration time to 24 hours (60 * 60 * 24 seconds).

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
The only way to access the private or public object is using the `key` of object. Most of the times the `key` of object is stored in the database along side the other properties of entity. Frontend can call the API to get the URL of the object using the `key` of the object.
</Callout>

In the similar way we can create the methods to delete the object in the `DmsService` class.

`dms/dms.service.ts`
```ts
async deleteFile(key: string) {
    try {
      const command = new DeleteObjectCommand({
        Bucket: this.bucketName,
        Key: key,
      });

      await this.client.send(command);

      return { message: 'File deleted successfully' };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new InternalServerErrorException(error);
    }
  }

```


Here's how the final code for the `DmsService` looks like:

`dms/dms.service.ts`
```ts


import { Injectable, InternalServerErrorException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';
import {
  S3Client,
  PutObjectCommand,
  DeleteObjectCommand,
  GetObjectCommand,
} from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { getSignedUrl } from '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

@Injectable()
export class DmsService {
  private client: S3Client;
  private bucketName = this.configService.get('S3_BUCKET_NAME');

  constructor(
    private readonly configService: ConfigService,
  ) {
    const s3_region = this.configService.get('S3_REGION');

    if (!s3_region) {
      this.logger.warn('S3_REGION not found in environment variables');
      throw new Error('S3_REGION not found in environment variables');
    }

    this.client = new S3Client({
      region: s3_region,
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: this.configService.get('S3_ACCESS_KEY'),
        secretAccessKey: this.configService.get('S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
      },
      forcePathStyle: true,
    });

  }

  async uploadSingleFile({
    file,
    isPublic = true,
  }: {
    file: Express.Multer.File;
    isPublic: boolean;
  }) {
    try {
      const key = `${uuidv4()}`;
      const command = new PutObjectCommand({
        Bucket: this.bucketName,
        Key: key,
        Body: file.buffer,
        ContentType: file.mimetype,
        ACL: isPublic ? 'public-read' : 'private',

        Metadata: {
          originalName: file.originalname,
        },
      });

      const uploadResult = await this.client.send(command);

  
      return {
        url: isPublic
          ? (await this.getFileUrl(key)).url
          : (await this.getPresignedSignedUrl(key)).url,
        key,
        isPublic,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new InternalServerErrorException(error);
    }
  }

  async getFileUrl(key: string) {
    return { url: `https://${this.bucketName}.s3.amazonaws.com/${key}` };
  }

}

```



## Controller Implementation

In the `dms.controller.ts` file, we can create the different routes to upload, access public and private object and delete the object and get the URL of the object.

`dms/dms.controller.ts`
```ts
import {
  Body,
  Controller,
  FileTypeValidator,
  Get,
  HttpCode,
  HttpStatus,
  MaxFileSizeValidator,
  Param,
  ParseFilePipe,
  Post,
  UploadedFile,
  UploadedFiles,
  UseGuards,
  UseInterceptors,
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { FileInterceptor } from '@nestjs/platform-express';
import { DmsService } from './dms.service';


@Controller('dms')
export class DmsController {
  constructor(private readonly dmsService: DmsService) {}

  @Post('/file')
  @UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))
  async uploadFile(
    @UploadedFile(
      new ParseFilePipe({
        validators: [
          new FileTypeValidator({ fileType: '.(png|jpeg|jpg)' }),
          new MaxFileSizeValidator({
            maxSize: MAX_FILE_SIZE, // 10MB
            message: 'File is too large. Max file size is 10MB',
          }),
        ],
        fileIsRequired: true,
      }),
    )
    file: Express.Multer.File,
    @Body('isPublic') isPublic: string,
  ) {
    const isPublicBool = isPublic === 'true' ? true : false;
    return this.dmsService.uploadSingleFile({ file, isPublic: isPublicBool });
  }

  @Get(':key')
 async getFileUrl(@Param('key') key: string) {
    return this.dmsService.getFileUrl(key);
  }

 @Get('/signed-url/:key')
  async getSingedUrl(@Param('key') key: string) {
    return this.dmsService.getPresignedSignedUrl(key);
  }

 @Delete(':key')
  async deleteFile(@Param('key') key: string) {
    return this.dmsService.deleteFile(key);
  }
}

``` 

In the above code, we have created the different routes to upload the file, get the URL of the file, get the pre-signed URL of the file and delete the file.
Also we have added bit of validation for the file type and file size using the `FileTypeValidator` and `MaxFileSizeValidator` classes to validate the file type and file size respectively.


## Testing the API via Postman

To test the API, we can use the Postman to upload the file, get the public URL of the file and get the pre-signed URL of the file.
Refer the below screenshots to test the API using Postman.

- Upload the public file to S3 bucket

<Image
    src={"/_static/blogs/aws-s3-nestjs/public-file-postman.png"}
    width={1280}
    height={720}
    alt="upload public file"
/>


- Upload the private file to S3 bucket

<Image
    src={"/_static/blogs/aws-s3-nestjs/private-file-postman.png"}
    width={1280}
    height={720}
    alt="upload private file"
/>

- Get the public URL of the file

<Image
    src={"/_static/blogs/aws-s3-nestjs/public-url-postman.png"}
    width={1280}
    height={720}
    alt="get public file url"
/>


- Get the pre-signed URL of the private file

<Image
    src={"/_static/blogs/aws-s3-nestjs/signed-url-postman.png"}
    width={1280}
    height={720}
    alt="get private file url"
/>


You might seen different response format in the Postman as compared to the screenshot above, as I've formatted response. If you want to 
learn how to format the response in NestJS, you can refer to my previous article on [Format Nest.js Response using Interceptors](https://adarsha.dev/blog/format-nestjs-response).
