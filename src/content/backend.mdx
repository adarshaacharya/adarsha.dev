There's been massive innovation in the database and backend space for developers building applications with serverless and edge compute. There are new tools, companies, and even programming models that simplify how developers store data.

This post will be an overview of databases that pair well with modern application and compute providers.

# Introduction

Markdown and Mdx parsing is supported via `unified`, and other remark and rehype packages. `next-mdx-remote` allows us to parse `.mdx` and `.md` files in a more flexible manner without touching webpack.

GitHub flavored markdown is used. `mdx-prism` provides syntax highlighting capabilities for code blocks. Here's a demo of how everything looks.

The following markdown cheatsheet is adapted from: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

# Syntax guide

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Headers

```
# This is a h1 tag

## This is a h2 tag

#### This is a h4 tag
```

# This is a h1 tag

## This is a h2 tag

#### This is a h4 tag

## Emphasis

```
_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_
```

_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

## Lists

### Unordered

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

### Ordered

```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

## Images

```

## Blockquotes

```
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Inline code

```
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

## Syntax highlighting

Here’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

````
```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

## Footnotes

```
Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.
```

## Task Lists

```
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```

- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```
| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

## Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear ~~crossed out~~.

```js
console.log({ hi: 23423 });
```

lorem100

```tsx
Hello, World!`;

const homePage = `export default function Page() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl mb-8 tracking-tighter">my portfolio</h1>
      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        This is your new portfolio.
      </p>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Vanilla CSS

Like most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.

```html title="index.html"
<h1 class="header">Welcome</h1>
```

```css title="index.css"
.header {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

# Other

I added [absolute Imports and module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) to improve the readability of nested imports inside files. Here's a before and after example:

```jsx
// Before
import db from "../../lib/db-admin";

// After
import db from "lib/db-admin";
```
