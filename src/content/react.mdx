## Vanilla CSS

Like most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.

```html title="index.html"
<h1 class="header">Welcome</h1>
```

```css title="index.css"
.header {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

# Other

I added [absolute Imports and module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) to improve the readability of nested imports inside files. Here's a before and after example:

```jsx
// Before
import db from "../../lib/db-admin";

// After
import db from "lib/db-admin";
```
